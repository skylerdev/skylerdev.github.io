## Playlist sharing made simple

Who's On Aux makes staying in touch with the party easy. At a glance, see what's playing and what's up next for the whole room. Add new songs easily.

### Get a party started

Start a room with one touch from the main menu. Give your room code to your friends. Import a playlist. And start adding music. It's that simple.

### It's up to you

The room owner has full control over what gets added. If some guests are being unruly, bounce them out. 

### When the party's over

Once you're done, you'll get a playlist of what was on during the party. Re-use it for future events, add songs you liked, or even get reccomendations based on the vibe. Share it on social media with #WhosOnAux for a shoutout.
