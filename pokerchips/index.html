  <h2>An easy way to play poker with your friends.</h2>

<!-- TODO: THIS NEEDS TO BE A GALLERY OF IMAGES/ SCREENSHOTS FROM POKER !!! -->

<p>A game of poker around the table is a great way to spend a night with friends. But it can be trouble setting up chips, cards, and keeping track of things.
  After looking on the app store for an easy way to play poker, I was left with nothing. It is from this and similar web applications I was inspired to create my own.
  Following the same simple design philosophy that made WhosOnAux so easy to use, I began work on what is now an almost fully functional standalone multiplayer poker experience,
with none of the bloat that typical poker applications will force on you.
